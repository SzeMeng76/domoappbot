This is a powerful, multi-functional Telegram bot for price lookups and more, containerized with Docker for easy deployment. Forked from the original [domoxiaojun/domoappbot](https://github.com/domoxiaojun/domoappbot) with significant feature enhancements, bug fixes, and a refactored architecture using MySQL and Redis.

### ‚ú® Features

-   **üí± Currency Conversion:** Real-time exchange rate lookups.
-   **üéÆ Steam Prices:** Query prices for Steam games and bundles across different regions.
-   **üì± App Stores:** Search for iOS, macOS, and iPadOS applications by keyword or directly by App ID, with support for multi-country price comparison.
-   **üì∫ Streaming Prices:** Check subscription costs for services like Netflix, Disney+, and Spotify.
-   **üîê Admin System:** A comprehensive, interactive admin panel (`/admin`) to manage user/group whitelists and bot administrators.
-   **üßπ Auto-Cleanup:** Automatically deletes commands and bot replies to keep group chats tidy.
-   **‚öôÔ∏è Fully Containerized:** The entire application stack (bot, database, cache) is managed with Docker and Docker Compose for a simple, one-command startup.
-   **üöÄ Automated Setup:** The database schema is created automatically by the application on its first run, no manual `init.sql` needed.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Python
-   **Telegram Framework:** `python-telegram-bot`
-   **Database:** MySQL
-   **Cache:** Redis
-   **Deployment:** Docker & Docker Compose
-   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated Docker image builds and pushes.

### üöÄ Getting Started

Getting the bot up and running is designed to be as simple as possible.

#### Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
-   A Telegram Bot Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

#### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/SzeMeng76/domoappbot.git](https://github.com/SzeMeng76/domoappbot.git)
    cd domoappbot
    ```

2.  **Create your configuration file:**
    Copy the example file to create your own configuration. The bot will not start without it.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Edit the `.env` file:**
    Open the `.env` file with a text editor and fill in the required values. See the configuration section below for details.

4.  **Run the bot:**
    Start the entire application stack with a single command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    The bot will start, connect to the MySQL and Redis containers, and automatically create the necessary database tables on the first run.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All bot configurations are managed through the `.env` file.

### ü§ñ Usage Examples

-   `/help` - Get the full list of commands.
-   `/rate usd cny 100` - Convert 100 US Dollars to Chinese Yuan.
-   `/steam Elden Ring` - Search for the game "Elden Ring" on Steam.
-   `/app id1643375332 us jp` - Look up the price of an app by its ID in the US and Japan stores.

### üìñ Architecture & Advanced Usage

#### System Architecture
* **MySQL:** Used for persistent storage of user permissions, whitelists (users and groups), and administrator data.
* **Redis:** Acts as a high-performance cache for price data, exchange rates, and managing the message deletion schedule.
* **Automatic Database Initialization:** The application will automatically create the required database tables on its first startup.

#### Production Recommendations
* Set `DEBUG=false` in your `.env` file for a production environment.
* Configure multiple `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEYS` to increase API rate limits.
* Ensure the `logs` directory has write permissions.
* For larger-scale use, consider using managed or separate servers for MySQL and Redis.
* Regularly back up the MySQL database.

#### Further Documentation
* **Project Architecture:** `CLAUDE.md`
* **Docker Deployment:** `docker-compose.yml`
* **Database Schema:** `database/init.sql`
